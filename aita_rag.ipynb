      "\n",
      "Imagine a runaway trolley barreling down a track toward five people who are bound to it. You stand beside a switch that can divert the trolley onto a second track, where it will strike a single person who is also bound. The core question is: *Should you pull the switch?*  The problem is not merely a brain‑teaser; it exposes the competing demands of saving lives versus respecting the autonomy and dignity of the one person at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is a brief guide to how the most common ethical frameworks treat this dilemma.\n",
      "\n",
      "| Framework | Core Principle | How it Treats the Trolley Problem |\n",
      "|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------|\n",
      "| **Utilitarianism** | *Greatest overall good* (maximize net happiness or minimize suffering) | The “right” action is the one that yields the highest total benefit. Pulling the switch to save five at the cost of one maximizes net well‑being, so a utilitarian would *definitely* pull the lever. |\n",
      "| **Kantian/Deontological Ethics** | *Duty and universal moral law* (act only according to maxims that can be universalized; treat humanity as an end in itself) | The act of intentionally killing the single person is a violation of a universal moral law—*no one may be killed as a means to an end*.  Even though five are saved, the duty to respect the individual’s right to life overrides the consequential calculus.  A Kantian would therefore *not* pull the switch. |\n",
      "| **Rights Theory** | *Protection of individual rights* (especially the right not to be harmed) | The single person’s right to life is paramount.  If that right can be violated, then the action is morally impermissible, regardless of the benefits to others.  Rights‑theorists would also refuse to pull the switch. |\n",
      "| **Deontological (Other variants)** | *Rule‑based duties* (e.g., “do not kill unless it is your duty to do so”) | Many deontologists share Kant’s stance: the act of killing, even if it saves lives, violates a rule that must not be broken.  Thus, they would *not* pull the lever. |\n",
      "| **Virtue Ethics** | *Character and moral virtues* (justice, compassion, prudence, etc.) | Virtue ethics asks which action a *virtuous* person would do.  A compassionate person might pull the switch to help five people, but a just and respectful person would refrain, because it would be unjust to sacrifice one for the many.  Virtue ethics therefore allows a range of responses, shaped by the particular virtues one values. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why These Differences Matter\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Outcome‑oriented vs. duty‑oriented** – Utilitarianism cares about the numbers; Kantian ethics cares about the moral rule that was violated.  \n",
      "* **Individual rights vs. collective welfare** – Rights theory protects the one; utilitarianism focuses on the majority.  \n",
      "* **Character vs. principle** – Virtue ethics centers on the moral agent’s disposition, rather than on abstract rules or calculable outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Take‑away for the Trolley Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "- **If you value the maximization of overall well‑being, you will pull the switch** (utilitarian).  \n",
      "- **If you value absolute duties or individual rights, you will not pull the switch** (Kantian, rights‑based, most deontological views).  \n",
      "- **If you judge the situation by the virtues a good person would exhibit, you may or may not pull the switch, depending on which virtues you consider most important** (virtue ethics).\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, the trolley problem forces us to pick between different moral priorities: saving lives, upholding duties, protecting rights, or cultivating virtuous character. Each framework gives a clear, though distinct, answer, and the debate continues to illuminate how we think about moral action in real‑world dilemmas.\n"
